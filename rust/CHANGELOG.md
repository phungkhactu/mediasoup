* Add convenience methods for getting information from `TransportTuple` enum, especially local IP/port
* Add `mid` option in `ConsumerOptions` to provide way to override MID
* Add convenience method `ConsumerStats::cosumer_stat()`

### 0.8.0

* `NonClosingProducer` removed (use `PipedProducer` instead, they were identical)
* `RtpHeaderExtensionUri::as_str()` now takes `self` instead of `&self`
* `kind` field of `RtpHeaderExtension` is no longer optional
* Refactor `ScalabilityMode` from being a string to enum, make sure layers are not zero on type system level
* Concrete types for info field of tracing events

### 0.7.2

* Thread and memory safety fixes in mediasoup-sys
* macOS support
* `NonClosingProducer` renamed into `PipedProducer` with better docs
* Internal restructuring of modules for better compatibility with IDEs
* Feature level updated to mediasoup `3.7.6`

### 0.7.0

* Switch from running C++ worker processes to worker threads using mediasoup-sys that wraps mediasoup-worker into library

* Enable Rust 2018 idioms warnings
* Make sure all public types have `Debug` implementation on them
* Enforce docs on public types and add missing documentation
